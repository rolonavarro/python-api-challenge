- Looking at the scatter plots I was able to confirm that my code is right because 
Latitude vs. Temperature plot made sense. It is expected to see warmer temperature along the 
equator at latitude 0. The getting farther away from the equator you can see how the temperature
starts to decrease. As always there are some outliers, but there are other variables for that that we
are not taken into account.

- The scatter plot of Latitude vs, Wind Speed was very interesting to see the results. The majority of the results
seem to be the same along the scatter plot, but getting closer to latitude 40-60 it looks like the winds are much
stronger compared to latitude -60 and -50. One might think that there should be similar speeds above and below the
equator, but this seems not to be the case. 

- Not much can be said about the cloudiness scatter plot. The data seems similar along the latitude, the only outliers
are the north and south pole, it seems that those places are the ones with less clouds.
